 ### Installation

Not yet on [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) so clone from this repository and build with [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) or [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

 ### Compatibility

Tested with [ghc](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) 7.10.3 and 8.0.1.

 ### Known Bugs and Infelicities

* Works incorrectly with data types with more than 5 type variables.
